According to the project_instruction, there are 4 main objectives

2) Identify the dog breeds
1) classify dog or not dog
4) Time and accuracy tradeoff
3) which model is best, meaning within CNN, we are using 3 CNNs times 

I will be writing functions in the check_images.py file to accomplish the above mentioned four objectives. 

So lets go to check_images.py file 

1) The performance of a CNN model can be seen when the classification or the output of the model matches with the file name of the image in the pet_images file.
