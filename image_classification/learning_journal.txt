According to the project_instruction, there are 4 main objectives

2) Identify the dog breeds
1) classify dog or not dog
4) Time and accuracy tradeoff
3) which model is best, meaning within CNN, we are using 3 CNNs times 

I will be writing functions in the check_images.py file to accomplish the above mentioned four objectives. 

So lets go to check_images.py file 

1) The performance of a CNN model can be seen when the classification or the output of the model matches with the file name of the image in the pet_images file. 

2) It took me two days to make sense of the instruction and i'm not even close to fully understanding why, how, what to do next. 

So my understanding is that i need to edit check_images file.
